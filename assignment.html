            <p id="p1" style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation or layout of a document written in a markup language. While HTML is used to structure the content of a webpage, CSS is used to apply visual styles to that content, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.

                CSS allows developers to separate the presentation of a webpage from its structure, which leads to several benefits. For example, CSS enables easier maintenance and customization of the visual styles, better performance due to the ability to cache styles, and improved accessibility.
                
                CSS can be applied to HTML documents using different methods, such as inline styles, internal stylesheets, or external stylesheets. External stylesheets are the most common and recommended way, as they allow for better separation of concerns and reusability of styles across multiple pages.
                
                Overall, CSS is an essential technology for creating visually appealing and responsive websites, as it provides developers with the flexibility and control they need to create unique and engaging user experiences.</p>

            <p id="p1" style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.

                Each individual piece markup code is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.</p>
